<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>Serial Logger Service can be configured using the Serial Logger Service Configuration 
program that is found in the Start Menu.</p>
<p><em>Note: You must be logged in as an administrator in order to change the configuration 
or control the service in any way (start, stop, pause, continue).</em></p>

<p>After making configuration changes, you must restart the services for the changes 
to take effect. You can do this by right-clicking on the affected instances and 
clicking <b>Restart</b> on the popup menu.</p>

<h1>Service Instances</h1>
<p>Serial Logger Service now allows multiple simultaneous instances to run. Each 
instance has a completely independent set of configuration parameters such as serial 
port configuration, log file, rotation options, timeout options, e-mail options, 
and ODBC options. Each instance
can be independently controlled (start, stop, pause, continue).
When you first start the Serial Logger Service Configuration program, the first 
instance will be created automatically. If you wish to run multiple instances, just 
select <b>New</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu and a new instance will be created. 
The number of instances you can have is limited only by the number of serial ports 
you have.</p>

<h1>Service Instance List</h1>

<p>The main window shows the list of service instances.  The list is divided into the following columns.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Instance</dt>
  <dd>The instance number.  The first instance is usually number 1.  The instance number
  is not related to the serial port number.  It is just a way to identify each service instance.</dd>
  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd>The serial port that the service instance reads from.</dd>
  <dt>Status</dt>
  <dd>The status of the service instance.  It will show Running, Stopped, or Paused. If it is
  blank, then the service instance is not yet installed. You must save the configuration to
  install the service.</dd>
  <dt>Auto Start</dt>
  <dd>The service instance auto start setting.  If Yes, then the service is configured to start when Windows 
  starts. Otherwise, the service must be started manually.</dd>
  <dt>Log File</dt>
  <dd>The log file the the service instance is configured to write to.  If log rotation
  is enabled, this will show only the base file name without the date/time suffix.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Menu Commands</h1>

<p>The following menu commands are available from the main window.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>File Menu</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>Save Settings</dt>
    <dd>This command saves the configuration to the Windows Registry and modifies 
    the Windows Services database as necessary to create the requested number of 
    service instances. The configuration is also saved automatically before starting 
    or restarting any services.</dd>
    <dt>Exit</dt>
    <dd>Exits the configuration application. Any services that are running will 
    continue to run in the background, even if the user logs off.</dd>
  </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Edit Menu</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>Note: Any configuration changes made through this menu are saved only
    when the <b>Save Settings</b> menu command is selected or when 
    starting a service. Also, any configuration changes are not actually applied
    until the affected services are restarted.</dt>
    <dt>Properties</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Opens the properties window for the selected instances. The properties window 
    is divided into three pages.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="config-general.html">General</a></li>
      <li><a href="config-timeout.html">Timeout Settings</a></li>
      <li><a href="config-email.html">E-mail</a></li>
      <li><a href="config-odbc.html">ODBC</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If multiple instances are selected, the configuration of the last selected 
    instance will effectively be copied to all other selected instances. All fields 
    are overwritten except for the serial port name and the log file name.</p>
    <p>After making configuration changes, the affected services must be restarted 
    for the changes to take effect.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>New</dt>
    <dd>Creates a new additional instance. The new instance will have completely 
    independent configuration settings from other instances.</dd>
    <dt>Duplicate</dt>
    <dd>Copies the configuration parameters of the selected instance to a new instance.</dd>
    <dt>Select All</dt>
    <dd>Highlights all instances.</dd>
    <dt>Delete</dt>
    <dd>Deletes all selected instances. If you accidently delete an instance, you 
    should exit the configuration application and answer No when prompted to save 
    the configuration.</dd>
  </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Service Menu</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>Start</dt>
    <dd>Saves the configuration and then starts the selected services.</dd>
    <dt>Stop</dt>
    <dd>Stops the selected services.</dd>
    <dt>Restart</dt>
    <dd>Saves the configuration, stops any selected services that are running, and then starts all selected 
    services.</dd>
    <dt>Continue</dt>
    <dd>Continues any selected services that are paused. This command causes a service 
    to reopen its log file and write any buffered data that was received while the 
    service was paused.</dd>
    <dt>Pause</dt>
    <dd>Pauses any selected services that are running. When a service is paused, 
    it releases the lock on the log file so that it can be modified, deleted, or 
    moved. While the service is paused, any data received on the serial port will 
    be stored in an internal buffer and then written to the log file when the service 
    is continued. Therefore, as long as the service is not stopped, no serial data 
    will be lost. Please click <a href="running.html">here</a> for details.</dd>
    <dt>Start Automatically</dt>
    <dd>When checked, the selected services are configured to start when Windows 
    starts. Otherwise, a service must be started manually.</dd>
    <dt>Event Viewer</dt>
    <dd>Launches the Windows Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe). The Application Log in 
    Event Viewer contains detailed information about the status of the services.
