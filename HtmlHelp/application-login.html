<h1>Sending Login Commands</h1>

<p>Some serial devices require that they receive a "login" or "start" command before they start
sending serial data to Serial Logger Service. Currently, Serial Logger Service has no capability
to send data to the serial port. However, with a creative batch file, you may be able to use the
Custom Timeout Command feature to send such a "login" command.</p>

<p>The timeout feature allows a program or batch file to run whenever no data is received
for a specified amount of time.
To accomplish your goal, you use the Custom Timeout Command to run a batch file that will stop the service, 
send the "login" command to the serial port, and then restart the service.  The service must be
stopped because when it is running, no other application may access the serial port.</p>

<p>Here's an example of such a batch file called CustomTimeoutCommand.cmd.</p>

<pre>net stop seriallogger1
echo myusername > com2
echo mypass > com2
echo start send > com2
net start seriallogger1
</pre>

<p>After creating this batch file, configure Serial Logger Service as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Timeout Settings properties page, set "Timeout if no data is received in __ seconds" to
  whatever is appropriate.  If no data is received for this many seconds, then the service will run the batch file.
  If you expect that normal operation of the serial device sends data at least every 5 minutes,
  then set this to 300 seconds.</li>
  <li>Check all days of the week and the Entire Day checkbox.</li>
  <li>Enter the full path and file name for CustomTimeoutCommand.cmd in the Custom timeout command field.</li>
  <li>Restart the service so that the new parameters take effect.</li>
</ol>

<p>One drawback to this method is that when the service is first started, 
the "login" command is not sent immediately. It will only be sent after waiting
for the specified number of seconds. This problem can be minimized by choosing a smaller value
for the timeout seconds.</p>

<p>If the serial device requires a complex login sequence that simple "echo" commands can't accomplish,
you may use any console-mode (command-line) application that can be scripted to communicate
with a serial port. Perl should work well for most applications.</p>

<p>An alternative to the timeout approach is to use the Windows Scheduler service (Scheduled Tasks)
to run the same CustomTimeoutCommand.cmd batch file on a periodic basis such as every hour.
However, you run the risk of losing a small amount of data if it is received during the brief period
when the service is stopped.</p>
