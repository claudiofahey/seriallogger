<h1>Instance Properties (ODBC)</h1>
<p>In addition to or instead of writing to a plain text log file, Serial Logger Service
can be configured to write directly to an ODBC database.  This allows data to be
written to any ODBC-compatible database including Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access,
Oracle, dBase, FoxPro, Paradox, and many others.    This feature
is only useful for text data where each line ends in a carriage return and/or line feed 
(ASCII 0D and 0A).</p>
<p>If you want to log only to an ODBC data source and not to a plain text log 
file, then simply leave the Log File field blank. If it is blank, then all log 
file-related functions will not work, including log rotation, and e-mailing of 
log files.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When logging to an ODBC data source, there are a lot more elements that may
not work compared to logging to a plain text log file. It is also significantly more
resource intensive and may be too slow to keep up with incoming data for some applications.
Because of this, ODBC logging should only be used if it is required for a certain
application.</p>
<p>All of the following parameters are required in order to have Serial Logger Service write to an
ODBC database.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Connect String <em>(required)</em></dt>
  <dd><p>This is the ODBC connection string which specifies, the ODBC Data Source Name (DSN), the user name and
  password, and any other parameters required by the ODBC driver to establish a connection.
  The easiest way to determine this is to click the <b>Build Connect String</b> button and
  browse for the correct DSN.</p>
  <p>If you are using a DSN which uses NTLM authentation such as a SQL Server Trusted Connection,
  you may need to <a href="servicesecurity.html">change the service's logon account</a>
  to a user that has been granted access to the DSN.</p>
  <p>The entire ODBC connection string is stored in the Registry. If you are using a DSN which
  requires a password to be stored in the connection string, then you should restrict access to the
  associated registry key. To do this, use REGEDT32.EXE and modify the security of the registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SerialLogger<i>X</i>\Parameters
  (where <i>X</i> is the instance number) so that
  only trusted accounts have read access to it. For Serial Logger Service to function properly,
  the SYSTEM account must have read access to this key and all of its subkeys.</p></dd>
  <dt>Build Connect String button</dt>
  <dd><p>Click this button to browse for or create an ODBC DSN.
  After selecting a DSN, you will be prompted for any other required information
  such as your user name and password.</p>
  <p>Since Serial Logger Service usually runs under the
  <a href="servicesecurity.html">SYSTEM account</a>, it is recommended that a Machine Data Source
  that is available to all users on the machine (System Data Source) be used.</p></dd>
  <dt>SQL Statement <em>(required)</em></dt>
  <dd><p>This is the actual SQL statement that will be executed after each line is read from the
  serial port. The end of each line is delimited by a carriage return and/or a line feed.
  This statement must have exactly one parameter marker which is identified
  as a question mark (?). When the statement executes, the parameter will be replaced
  with the actual text that was read from the serial port.
  The carriage return and line feed characters are not included as part of the parameter.
  Only one parameter marker
  may be specified.</p>
  <p>The following are examples of the variety of SQL statements that
  are possible. Except for the first statement, these may not work with
  all ODBC data sources.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>INSERT INTO PhoneLog (line) VALUES (?)</dt>
    <dd>This is the type of statement created with the <b>Build SQL Statement</b> button.  It inserts
    the entire line into the single column called <i>line</i> of the table called <i>PhoneLog</i>.
    This statement works with all types of ODBC data sources.</dd>
    <dt>INSERT INTO [Phone Log] ([line data]) VALUES (?)</dt>
    <dd>This is like the above statement but shows how to use square brackets around the table name
    and column name when they contain spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters.</dd>
    <dt>INSERT INTO PhoneLog (PortName, Line) SELECT 'COM2', ?</dt>
    <dd>This is like the first statement but also puts the value "COM2" into the column called
    <i>PortName</i>. Such a statement is useful if you record data from several sources into the
    same table.</dd>
    <dt>INSERT INTO PhoneLog (line) SELECT {fn SUBSTRING(?,10,20)}</dt>
    <dd>This is like the first statement but only inserts 20 characters of the line starting
    at the 10th character.  The "{fn SUBSTRING}" part is an ODBC escape sequence
    that is converted by the ODBC driver into the native SQL function that is appropriate
    for the data source.</dd>
    <dt>{call ProcessLine(?)}</dt>
    <dd>This statement runs a procedure called ProcessLine and passes the entire line as
    its first parameter. The procedure is defined by the data source and can perform a variety
    of tasks such as parsing the line into fixed-width or comma-delimited fields.
		<p>You can create a procedure in Microsoft Access 2000 or above by 
		creating a parameter query such as this:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARAMETERS line Text ( 255 );<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSERT INTO tblData ( f2, f3 )<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT Left([line],4) AS Expr2, Mid([line],5,8) AS Expr3;<br />		
		</p>
		</dd>
    <dt>
    DECLARE @s varchar(4000)<br />
    SET	 @s = ?<br />
    INSERT INTO PhoneLog (time, part1, part2) SELECT GETDATE(), LEFT(@s,9), SUBSTRING(@s,10,20)
    </dt>
    <dd>This set of statements works with Microsoft SQL Server and shows how to use a temporary
    variable to split a fixed-width line into two fields. This could also be accomplished
    using a stored procedure.</dd>
    <dt>
    INSERT INTO PhoneLog (line, part1, part2) VALUES (@line:=?, MID(@line,1,9), MID(@line,10,20))
    </dt>
    <dd>This set of statements works with MYSQL and shows how to use a temporary
    variable to split a fixed-width line into two fields.</dd>
  </dl>
 
  </dd>
  <dt>Build SQL Statement button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to automatically create a simple SQL statement that inserts the data
  into a single text column of a table.</dd>
  <dt>Execute With Test String button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to execute the SQL statement with a simple test string. This is useful
  to verify that the SQL statement is valid.</dd>
  <dt>Max Line Length <em>(required)</em></dt>
  <dd><p>This is the maximum number of characters that will be passed as the parameter to the SQL
  statement. If you are inserting the data into a single column, this should be the maximum 
  number of characters that the column can hold.  Any lines that exceed this number of
  characters will be truncated when the SQL statement is executed.</p>
  <p>This setting does not affect the length of each line written to the plain text log file.
  The plain text log file has no limitations for the length of each line.</p></dd>
