<h1>Restrictions in the Unregistered Version</h1>

<p>To allow for a complete evaluation of Serial Logger Service, the unregistered 
(shareware) version has the same capabilities as the registered version except 
that it will run for only a limited time. When the service starts, it randomly 
picks a time from 0 to 14 days after which the service will stop itself. If 
further evaluation is required, the service can be restarted, provided 30
days has not passed since its first use.  The time duration for which the service will run 
and the number of days left in the 30 day evaluation period is recorded in the 
<a href="eventviewer.html">Windows Event Log</a> upon service startup.</p>
