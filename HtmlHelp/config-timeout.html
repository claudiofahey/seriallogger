<h1>Instance Properties (Timeout Settings)</h1>
<p>The Timeout Settings page contains advanced settings usually used to notify an administrator
if no data is received on the serial port in a certain amount of time.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Never timeout</dt>
  <dd>Select this if you do not want to use timeouts.  This is the default selection.
  All other settings on this page are disregarded if this is selected.</dd>
  <dt>Timeout if no data is received in <i>x</i> seconds</dt>
  <dd>Select this if you want to use timeouts.  If no data is received on the serial port
  after this many seconds, then the timeout command specified below will be run.</dd>
  <dt>Run timeout command only once</dt>
  <dd>If this is selected, the timeout command specified below will be run only once for each idle period.</dd>
  <dt>Run timeout command every <i>x</i> seconds</dt>
  <dd>If this is selected, the timeout command will run every <i>x</i> seconds until at least one
  character is received on the serial port.</dd>
  <dt>Only timeout on the following days</dt>
  <dd>Specify which days of the week should be monitored for timeouts.  For example, if you are using 
  Serial Logger Service to monitor a PBX system which has little or no phone traffic on the weekends, then
  you can select only Monday through Friday.</dd>
  <dt>Only timeout between the following times</dt>
  <dd>Specify which times of the day should be monitored for timeouts.  If you select the Entire Day checkbox,
  then the entire day from midnight to the following midnight will be monitored.  The time range specified
  will apply to all days of the week that are checked in the preceding section.  For example, if you are using 
  Serial Logger Service to monitor a PBX system which has little or no phone traffic before 9:00 AM or
  after 6:00 PM, then enter 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM.</dd>
  <dt>Custom timeout command</dt>
  <dd>The specified program is run in response to a timeout as defined in the preceding fields.
  This command must refer to a valid .EXE or .CMD file that can be run from the service.  An example
  of such a command may be a command-line application that sends an e-mail or calls a pager.  If the
  program path contains a space, the path should be enclosed in double quotes.  Any parameters to the
  program can follow the program path.  Please note that the application is run in the same security
  context as the service. Please click <a href="servicesecurity.html">here</a> for more information
  regarding service security.</dd>
  <dt>Net Send recipient list</dt>
  <dd>In addition to or instead of the Custom timeout command, you can simply enter a list of 
  Microsoft Networking user or workstation names that will receive popup messages whenever timeouts occur.
  When a timeout occurs, a Microsoft Networking popup message will be sent to the specified workstations.
  Up to 10 user or workstation names can be specified, separated by commas.  The message is sent
  using the Windows NET.EXE SEND command.  The recipient names much match the Microsoft Networking user logon name
  (without the NT domain prefix) or the workstation name (defined in My Computer Properties).</dd>
