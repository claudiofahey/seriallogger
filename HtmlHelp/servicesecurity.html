<h1>Service Security</h1>

<p>Since Serial Logger Service runs as a service, it does not run under the logged in user's security
context.  Instead, it defaults to running under the SYSTEM account which only has access to the
workstation on which the service is running.  This creates a problem if the log file resides
on a remote workstation (for example, if a UNC path such as "\\logserver\logs\log.txt" is specified),
if the custom timeout command is on a remote workstation or uses resources on a remote
workstation, or if an ODBC connection requires a specific user to logon.</p>

<p>To resolve this problem, the log file, custom timeout command, and/or ODBC 
database server must be
on the local workstation and the SYSTEM account must have proper access.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the
service can be configured to logon as a particular user who has proper access.  To change the logon
user for the service, you can use the Services applet in the Control Panel.  Please refer
to your Windows documentation for further information about service security.</p>
