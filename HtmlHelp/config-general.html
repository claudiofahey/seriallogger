<h1>Instance Properties (General)</h1>
<p>The general page contains the basic configuration settings for the service 
instance.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Serial port</dt>
  <dd>This is the serial port which the service will read from. The port may be 
  selected from the list or it may be typed in manually if it is not on the list. 
  When the service starts, it must have exclusive access to this port.&nbsp; No 
  other applications may be using this port.</dd>
  <dt>Speed (BPS)</dt>
  <dd>This is the port speed in bits per second, sometimes called the baud rate. 
  The speed may be selected from the list or it may be typed in manually if it is 
  not on the list.</dd>
  <dt>Byte Size</dt>
  <dd>This is the number of bits per byte. It is usually 7 (with parity) or 8 (without 
  parity) but can be any value between 4 and 8.</dd>
  <dt>Parity</dt>
  <dd>The parity can be none, odd, even, mark, or space.</dd>
  <dt>Stop Bits</dt>
  <dd>The number of stop bits can be 1, 1.5, or 2.</dd>
  <dt><a name="Timestamp">Timestamp</a></dt>
  <dd>When set to Yes, each line in the log file will be prefixed with the current time in
  the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.sss:". Resolution up the millisecond is provided for
  time-sensitive applications.</dd>
  <dt>Log File</dt>
  <dd>The log file is the full path to the file which will be written by the service. 
  Any data received from the specified serial port will be written to the log file. 
  No translation is performed on the data received from the serial port. If you 
  are using file security (NTFS), then you must ensure that the service account has write 
  access to this file. By default, the service account is the SYSTEM 
  built-in account. If the log file refers to a UNC path (ie. \\myserver\logs\log.txt), 
  then you must set the service account to a valid user with access to the specified 
  server.  Please click <a href="servicesecurity.html">here</a> for more information
  regarding service security.</dd>
  <dt>Browse button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to open a file dialog that will allow to select a log file
  path and name.</dd>
  <dt>Open button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to view the log file. If the file type is associated with an
  application, the application will be started.  Otherwise, Windows Notepad will be
  started. If Log Rotation is enabled, the current log file will be opened.
  <b>Note:</b> Some application may not be able to open the file when the
  service is running.  If the application reports a file in use error, you may
  need to <a href="running.html">pause</a> the service before opening the log file in the application.</dd>
  <dt><a name="LogRotation">Log Rotation</a></dt>
  <dd>When this feature is enabled (any setting other than None), the log file name
  is time stamped and a new log file is created periodically.  The time stamp format
  depends on the selected period.  For instance, if the Log File is set to
  "pbx.log" and the Log Rotation setting is Daily, then each log file created
  will have the format "pbxYYYYMMDD.log".  On March 21st, 2002, the log file
  will be "pbx20020321.log".  Please note that the final extension (after the final period),
  remains at the end of the file name.  The following table shows the possible values
  for this setting:
  <table>
  <tr><th>Log Rotation</th> <th>New Log On</th> <th>File Name Suffix Format</th></tr>
  <tr><td>None</td> <td>never</td> <td><i>none</i></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Monthly</td> <td>1st of month at 00:00:00 (midnight)</td> <td>yyyymm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Weekly</td> <td>Sunday at 00:00:00</td> <td>yyyymmdd</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Daily</td> <td>00:00:00</td> <td>yyyymmdd</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hourly</td> <td><i>hh</i>:00:00, <i>hh</i> = 00 to 23</td> <td>yyyymmddhh</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Minutely</td> <td><i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:00</td> <td>yyyymmddhhmm</td></tr>
  </table>
  </dd>  
  <dt>Event Log Settings</dt>
  <dd>The service records significant events to the Windows Event Log. Select which 
  (if any) events should be recorded in the Application Event Log.  Use 
  <a href="eventviewer.html">Event Viewer</a> to view these events.</dd>
  <dt>Start automatically when Windows starts</dt>
  <dd>Check this box to mark the service as Automatic. This causes the service to 
  start when Windows starts, even before the a user logs on. This should be checked 
  if you want to make sure that the service always runs.</dd>
  <dt>OK button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to accept the service instance paramters.  The configuration is not saved
  until the <b>Save Settings</b> menu command is selected.  Also any configuration changes
  will not take effect until the service is restarted.</dd>
  <dt>Cancel button</dt>
  <dd>Click this button to cancel any changes made to the service instance parameters.</dd>
  <dt>Help button</dt>
  <dd>Opens the on-line help.</dd>
