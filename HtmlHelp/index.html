<h1 style="font-size: 150%">Serial Logger Service 1.21e</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Serial Logger Service is a Windows NT/2000/XP service that records all data
received on a serial port to a file on a disk or to an ODBC data source. It was
originally designed to record telephone traffic data from a phone system (PBX)
for later analysis. For this reason, it was designed to be very robust and
includes features to notify an administrator if no data is received in a
certain amount of time. However, Serial Logger Service is generic enough to be
useful whenever one-way serial traffic needs to be recorded.</p>

<p>Now Serial Logger Service has the capability to run multiple instances
simultaneously so that multiple ports can be logged.</p>

<p>Unlike most other serial logging applications, Serial Logger Service runs as
a service so that it starts as soon as the operating system starts and doesn't
require a user to log in and run it. It will continue to run even as users
logon and logoff the workstation. Since services are an advanced operating
system feature, Serial Logger Service does not run on Windows 95/98/Me.</p>

<h1>Getting started with Serial Logger Service</h1>

<p>After you have successfully installed Serial Logger Service, use the
following simple steps to configure and run it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Serial Logger Service Configuration program from the Start

<li>Double-click on the first instance to edit its properties.</li>

<li><a href="config-general.html">Enter the serial port parameters (port name,
speed, parity, etc.)</a>.</li>

<li><a href="config-general.html">Enter the log filename that the service will
write to</a>. Then click OK to accept the properties.</li>

<li><a href="running.html">Right-click on the first instance and choose Start
from the popup menu. This will start the first service instance in the
background</a>.</li>

<li>Close the Serial Logger Service Configuration program. Any running
instances will continue to run in the background, recording any data received
to the specified log files.</li>
</ol>
