<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ol>

<li><p><b>After I start the service, it stops immediately.</b></p>
<p>This is usually caused by an invalid or in-use serial port or log file.  In 
the unregistered version, this will also occur if the service is started outside 
the 30 day evaluation period. Please refer to the
<a href="eventviewer.html">Windows Application Event Log</a> to see exactly why the service terminated. 
Click
<a href="unregisteredrestrictions.html">here</a> to find out about restrictions in the
unregistered version.</p></li>

<li><p><b>After I start the service, it stops after a few minutes, hours, or days.</b></p>
<p>The unregistered version will run for a random amount of time and then stop. Please refer to the
<a href="eventviewer.html">Windows Event Log</a> to see exactly why the service terminated.

unregistered version.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Can Serial Logger Service monitor more than one serial port?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Support for multiple instances is a new feature added to version 1.2.  Each serial port can be
logged to a separate log file.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Can multiple ports be written to the same log file?</b></p>
<p>No. Each instance must have exclusive write access to its log file.</p></li>

<li><p><b>How do I send a "login" or "start" command to the serial device that I want to monitor?</b></p>
<p>Click <a href="application-login.html">here</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p><b>How can I manually rotate the log file?</b></p>
<p>Click <a href="application-ondemandrotate.html">here</a> for details.</p></li>

<li><p><b>How can I view the serial port data in real time?</b></p>
<p>
	If you want to view data as it comes in, you can use a program such as the Unix-like "tail" program
	in combination with Serial Logger Service.  You can download a "free" version of Tail for Win32 from
	<a href="http://tailforwin32.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.
